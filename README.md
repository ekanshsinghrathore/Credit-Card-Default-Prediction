# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments.
Data Processing 1 = Columns headers in the first row. So we have to first make the column header by using a function.
Data Processing 2 = Changing the names of a few columns to make them more understandable.
EDA= In this part, we will do EDA and extract features which are going to be very useful for our Machine Learning Classification model.
Create a Model = Its the major part of this project which is going to help us in finding best test results. Here, we will use various algorithms for finding the best models and than tuning it according to our requirements.

Attribute Information:
This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:
X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.
X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).
X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).
X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).
X5: Age (year).
X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.
X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005.
X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.

As comparing and checking other criteria we decided to go with Decesion Tree Classifier and running some of its parameters to get better result
Decision Tree Classifier has given satisfactory accuracy results more than 0.80
ROC Curve also showed Decision Tree Classifier working well with the data
